A website designed for any mobile repair shop but really it can be adjusted to be used for many other businesses as well. Used many important aspects of HTML/CSS to create the various parts of the website such as:
-iframes, positioning, box-shadow
-flexbox and CSS grid
-custom properties, smooth scrolling, sticky navbar (with help of a bit of vanilla JavaScript)
-advanced selectors such as pseudo elements (::before, ::after), nth-of-child,nth-of-type
-transitions and animations
-website is fully optimized for accessibility purposes
-website is fully responsive for various screen sizes; desktop, tablet, mobile
-a little bit of JS to assist with hamburger menu on mobile devices and changing the bg color of navbar on scroll

CSS is mostly written using BEM methodology to create a hierarchy of classes for each section and improve code readibility but used some utility classes as well throughout. Hosted on Vercel and forms submissions are also fully functioning and were set up using Formspree.
